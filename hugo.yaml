    content: |-
      I'm a cybersecurity student and home lab builder with a passion for Linux, networking, and automation. I run my own cloud from home using Docker, Nginx Proxy Manager, and a stack of services to explore self-hosting and privacy-first technologies.

      My journey includes mastering ethical hacking, learning web app security, and crafting useful scripts in Bash and Python to make life easier (and cooler).
